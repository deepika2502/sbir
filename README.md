# SKETCH BASED IMAGE RETRIEVAL
Sketch Based Image Retrieval is a content based image retrieval technique where a drawing or a sketch is given as the input to the system and images are retrieved based on the class. 
This technique is advantageous when the user is aware of the subject he needs information about, but fails to express it verbally. The limitations of the system, in general, is the training process since it is practically impossible to train the model with new data or a new class each time.
